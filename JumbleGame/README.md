# Word Jumble (Game)
A simple word puzzle, where you need to reconstruct the "jumbled" word, in which letters are rearranged. Word is chosen *pseudorandomly* from 2D array of `std::string`, where the first index is the word, second is a hint (which you can display by enterring `h`).

Overall, the game is that easy, so even your grandma with severe dementia can beat it.
